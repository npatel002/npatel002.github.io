        <p> “Grey’s Anatomy”.  What comes to your mind when you hear those words? When I heard it first I thought it only had something to do with medicine and doctors. I was wrong about that. When I started watching it I was like okay this show probably just like other medical shows but as I started watching it, I started getting more involved and I learned that this show was much more than just about medicine and doctors. It is about relationships, teamwork, friendship, and gender roles. According to some studies, 80% the people who watch Grey’s Anatomy has shown interest in becoming doctors one day. It influences people in a good way. This show gives great examples of how important teamwork and friendship is. It also shows the subvert in traditional gender roles. 
        </p><p> No matter what you do in life, teamwork is always important. There is always a part of your life that requires teamwork, it could be your personal or professional life. I believe almost everything that we do is result of teamwork, for example, raising children, buying a house, selecting paint color for your house, and small things like selecting furniture for your house is teamwork, you and your partner have to work together to make it happen because if you do not, then it will be very chaotic. Just like in season 8, episode 2 when all the residents were having problems with each other, they were not working well together, Dr. Torres and Dr. Bailey gave all the residents a gunther. Gunther is a team building exercise when the doctors do not work very well together. After that, in season 8, episode 11 there was an impossible case of conjoined twins that the doctors had to separate. One little mistake both the babies would be dead. All the other hospitals and doctors said it was impossible to separate them without one of the babies dying but with teamwork of doctors at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the babies were successfully separated from each other and neither of the babies died and they were well and healthy. The surgery was about 18 hours long and the doctors were divided into two teams. They practiced this surgery with dolls for weeks, they brainstormed everything that could possibly go wrong and created a backup plan for all of the possibilities. All the doctors had to work as a team to make this surgery successful and they did. They succeeded; they would not have been able to do this if they had not worked together.
        </p><p> The other thing that we learn in this show is friendship. Like Christina said in season 3 episode 16, “If I murdered someone she’s the person I’d call to help me drag the corpse across the living room floor. She’s my person.”  In this show, Dr. Christina Yang and Dr. Meredith Grey have a very deep friendship. Christina and Meredith are today’s generations friendship goals. After watching this show everyone wants a friend that they can have a bond that is similar to what Christina and Meredith have. Christina and Meredith go through a lot of things together from their breakups, to their patient’s death, to Meredith kidnapping her daughter, to the mass shooting where Derek, Meredith’s boyfriend, gets shot at the hospital in season 6 episode 24,by a lunatic guy who’s grieving his wife’s death, or when Christina is left at the altar by Dr. Burke, to the part where Christina has a miscarriage in season 2 episode 3. They are  each others lifeline. They have been there for each other through thick and thin. So, when Christina leaves in season 10 episode 25 to go to Zurich for better opportunities, Meredith is lonely. She just lost the person that she has been going through all the stuff with. She cannot hold Christina back because she knows that Christina deserves what she is being offered in Zurich and that she will not get that opportunity again. After a while, Meredith starts having problems in her marriage. Since, Christina is not here anymore, Alex is her new “person.” Even though Alex is jerk most of the time, him and Meredith get along very well especially after Christina  leaves. Alex helps Meredith go through a lot of stuff, especially when Meredith is pregnant and Derek dies in a car wreck after saving four lives on the roadside in Season 11 episode 21. Also, Meredith is ready to risk her career in season 3 episode 1 to save Alex from losing his career because of one mistake that he made. 
        </p><p> The another important thing that this show depicts is the reversal of gender roles. This show breaks the mold of men being better than women and women being a housewife rather than working. In this show we can see that all the higher positions are carried out by women sooner or later. For Example, Dr. Bailey is chief of surgery, Dr. Altman is Chief of Cardiothoracic surgery in season 6,7, and 8, Dr. Grey is Chief of General surgery, Dr. Hahn- Chief of Cardiothoracic surgery in season 4 and 5, Dr. Montgomery- Chief of Neonatal Surgery, Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Dr. Pierce- Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery season 11,12, and 13, Dr. Robbins- Chief of Pediatric Surgery, and Dr. Torres- Chief of Orthopedic Surgery.  All these ladies are an inspiration to the ladies that are watching this show, this doctors are their motivation to become something more in their lives and to do something great that they would be remembered for. They inspire them to work and make progress instead of becoming  housewives. There is a huge difference between today’s gender roles and traditional gender roles where women stay home and bear children and take care of the house while her husband worked. The traditional gender roles have subverted completely. 
        </p><p> Overall, Grey’s Anatomy is a medical drama series. It revolves around the life of Dr. Meredith Grey. This show greatly influences people. It can help people with their confidence and particularly women. This show also has pretty good amount of diversity. It focuses on all races/ethnicity instead of some other shows. It gives people from different ethnicities hope that they can be like them too. That if they can get the education that they need, they can be successful too. It gives them feeling that they belong here. Grey’s Anatomy attracts audiences between the age of 18-49. It has a pretty wide range of audience. People are very invested in the show. Some people watch this show because of the relationships, some watch it because of their interest in the medical field, and for some it might just be the story and the plot. I watch this show because I feel like its very well written. And I loved Christina, she left in season 10, and Derek, who died in season 11, and now I am watching it because of Meredith and Alex and it is very interesting to see what friendship means to them and how ready they are to risk everything for each other. As a woman, Grey’s Anatomy gives me motivation to be like one of the women in the show.
